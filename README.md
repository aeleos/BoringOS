# VeOS
An experimental OS using Rust. Currently in a very early stage.

## Compiling
To compile VeOS you need xargo. Assuming you already have cargo installed, you need to run `cargo install xargo` to install it. Also run `rustup component add rust-src`. Then you just need to run make and it should compile.
